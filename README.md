# hand_tracker
A Python hand tracker script that uses OpenCV to detect and count the number 
of fingers you're holding up. This program detects the left or right hand
simultaneously.

This program is extremely buggy and doesn't work yet, let's make it awesome!
                                                                                
## Usage                                                                        
                                                                                
Run with Python or make the script executable, your choice:                     
                                                                                
```python                                                                       
python3 hand_recognizer.py                                                      
```                                                                             
                                                                                
While the script is running:                                                    
                                                                                
```                                                                             
Press q to quit.                                                                
```
